Went to the pages of National Heath Interview Survey and got the raw data for adult participants 2023 year.
Used the codebook to deciper encodings and to determine dependencies so that we do not make mistakes.
codes ending with 96 not available ; 97 refuse; 98 not ascertained; 99 do not know

Clustering:
1.	Check if any weights are non valid (100-299 pounds)
1.1 Drop all higher than 300
2.	Check if any hights are not valid (59-76 inches)
2.1 Drop all higher than 77
3.	Check for gender 1 male; 2 female
3.1	If 2 check for pregnancy 1-yes; 2-no; 7-refused; 8-not ascertained; 9 do not know
3.1.1	Leave only 2 (no pregnant women)
4.	Add BMI attribute to those that are left BMI = weight (lb) รท height2 (inches) * 703
5. Check the distribution of BMI and use GMM (gautian mixture model) to cluster the BMI
6. Validate it externally


2.
Multivariate regression model that predicts BMI based on a several independent variables:
2.1 Age (valid 18-84). 97-refuse 98-not ascertained 99-do not know. Drop all higher than 84 as they are all included in a separate category. 
2.2 Gender (valid 1-male; 2- female). 7-refused, 8-not ascertained, 9 -do not know. Drop all higher than 2.
2.3 Educational level (valid 0/no school-10/doctoral). 97-99 not valid. Drop all higher than 10 or think of reclassification (no hs, hs, higher education)
2.4 Current marital status 1-married, 2 cohabiting, 3 neither) 7-refused, 8-not ascert, 9-do not know. Drop all above 3, regroup to 1. Paired 2. Single
2.5 Income from wages (1-yes 2-no) 7-refused, 8 na 9 dn. Drop all higher than 2.
2.6 Residence owned or rented (1-yes, 2-renting, 3-ohers), but likely drop all higher than 2.
2.7 Raising a minor (parental status of sample adult) (1-yes, 2-stepparent, 3-no) 9-uknnown. Drop 9, regroup 1 and 2.
2.8 Depression frequency (1/daily-5/never). 7 ref, 8 na, 9 dn. Drop all higher than 5.
            / or anxiety (1/daily-5/never). 7 ref, 8 na, 9 dn. Drop all higher than 5.

urban_rural keep all classes
region all classes
canev_a cancer drop all above 2, 1 stays 1(yes), 2 becomes 0 (no)
